    <h1>AtmosBeats – Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="tagline">
      Last updated: <strong>December 2025</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>AtmosBeats</strong> (“the App”)
      handles information when you use our iOS application. We are committed to
      respecting your privacy and keeping the data we handle to the minimum
      necessary to provide the service.
    </p>

    <p class="meta">
      Data controller: <strong>Gürhan Kuraş</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Location data</h3>
    <p>
      AtmosBeats uses your location only to determine the local weather for
      your area and generate music recommendations that match the current
      weather conditions.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Location access is requested through the iOS system dialog.</li>
      <li>
        The App uses your location (for example, your city) to query a weather
        service.
      </li>
      <li>
        Location data is not used to track you across apps or websites and is
        not sold to third parties.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Usage information</h3>
    <p>
      The App may collect basic, non-personal usage information such as which
      screens are viewed or which features are used. This is only used to
      improve the App and understand how it performs.
    </p>

    <h3>1.3 Music preferences</h3>
    <p>
      Within the App you can select music genres and favourite artists. These
      preferences are used only to generate better music recommendations for
      you. They are not shared with advertisers.
    </p>

    <h3>1.4 No account required</h3>
    <p>
      AtmosBeats does not require you to create an account. We do not collect
      your name, email address or other contact details inside the App unless
      you contact us directly.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <p>We use the information described above to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide weather-based music recommendations tailored to you.</li>
      <li>Display relevant information such as location name and weather.</li>
      <li>Improve the design, performance and stability of the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>
      AtmosBeats integrates with a small number of third-party services to
      deliver its core functionality:
    </p>

    <h3>3.1 Weather provider</h3>
    <p>
      We use a weather API to retrieve current weather conditions based on your
      approximate location. The request may include your city, coordinates or
      region so that the correct weather data can be returned.
    </p>

    <h3>3.2 Spotify</h3>
    <p>
      AtmosBeats uses the Spotify service to search for music, fetch album
      artwork and open tracks in the Spotify app. When you choose to open a
      track, you are redirected to the official Spotify application or website.
      Your use of Spotify is governed by Spotify’s own Terms and Privacy
      Policy.
    </p>

    <h3>3.3 AI-based recommendation engine</h3>
    <p>
      The App may send anonymised prompts (for example, weather and genre
      information) to an AI service to generate music suggestions. We avoid
      including personal identifiers in these prompts.
    </p>

    <p>
      These third-party services may process data in accordance with their own
      privacy policies. We encourage you to review those policies separately.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Retention</h2>

    <p>
      We keep data only for as long as necessary to provide the App’s
      functionality and as required by applicable law. Weather information and
      generated recommendations are typically short-lived and not stored
      permanently with your identity.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>

    <p>
      AtmosBeats is not directed to children under the age of 13. If you are a
      parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with
      personal information, please contact us so that we can delete it.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Your Choices</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        You can disable location access at any time in your iOS device
        settings. The App may then use a default location or may not be able to
        provide weather-based recommendations.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can uninstall the App at any time to stop all data collection by
        AtmosBeats on your device.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>

    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, for example when we
      add new features or integrate new services. When we do so, we will change
      the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Continued use of the App
      after such changes means you accept the updated policy.
